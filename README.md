# BdA_insights
Github repo containing the code for data preparation of data for the BdA ICP.

This repo contains four files: the script for labeling the social media dataset (data_attributes), 
the script for the natural language processing of the posts on the social media channels (BdA_NLP),
the script for creating the full 'donations dataset', containing the number of posts per day and their subsequent attributes
to be able to compare to the donations made on that day (donations_dataset_full). With this dataset the regressions were eventually performed, which can be found in
the last script (BdA_regressions).

For any questions regarding the files in this repo, please contact itsepieter.kruyt@alumni.esade.edu.
